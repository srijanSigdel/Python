## About

This repo contains small projects, code snippets, exercises, and experiments as I learn programming. The goal is to explore different aspects of coding including:

- Basics: variables, loops, conditions, functions
- Data Structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples
- OOP: classes, objects, inheritance
- Modules & Packages
- File Handling
- Libraries: e.g., `requests`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- Small projects and scripts to apply knowledge
